# Configure Travis CI

# In order to test two different languages, we have to use a matrix (e.g. a parallel job)

matrix:
  include:
    - language: go
      go:
        # This will automatically choose the latest released Go version
        - 1.x
      before_script:
        # Install the Go linter
        # https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint
        - curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.24.0
        # Go to the Go source code
        - cd src
      script:
        # Compile the Go code
        - go install
        # Run the Golang linter
        - ./lint.sh

    - language: node_js
      node_js:
        - node
      before_script:
        # Install the JavaScript tooling (TypeScript, Webpack, etc.)
        - cd public/js
        - npm install
      script:
        # Run Webpack
        # (which compiles the TypeScript to JavaScript and packs everything into one file)
        # (we want to do this before linting so that the "version.json" file is created)
        - ../../build_client.sh
        # Run ESLint (the JavaScript linter)
        - npm run-script lint
